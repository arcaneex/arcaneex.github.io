Main idea
=========

The gamemode will span to multiple servers. Each server has it's own map but when you look at the maps you will notice they are connected and related to each other.
Each map will have it's guardian, players can form alliances to take down the guardian and control the map, then they can scavange valuable resources or trade with their guardian.
The controlling aliance will enjoy high skill crafting, higher chance of success, cheaper cost to craft and tax-free shops.
Other players and alliances that buy from the shops in the map pay a tax fee that goes into the controlling alliance bank.

You can go through tunnels, pathways, caves, forests to get to the other server (north/south/west/east) or pay a fee to teleport.

Features
========
Classes
Crafting.
Sigils that give you random bonuses.
Disassembling gear for craft materials.
Dying can and will drop random items from your inventory, unless the gear has the Saint Sigil embedded into it.
Enchanting gear will yield higher stats aswell as a fancy glow.
Olympiad for hero status, players will battle between their own class or class free to gain points, the highest point holder in their class gets Hero Status (glow/hero weapons/special crafts)

Classes
=======
Repellent (sniper rifle/bows)
Eviscerator (assault rifles)
Dreadnought (shotguns/heavy weapons man)
Cardinal (healer/buffer)

Each player starts off as either a Human or a Resang.
Human will be able to ascend to either a Fighter or a Rogue.
Resang will be able to ascend to either a Knight or a Cleric.

The classes go like this:

`	   /---Fighter---->Eviscerator`    
Human--    
`	   \---Rogue------>Repellent`    

    
`	   /---Knight------Dreadnought`    
Resang-    
`	   \---Cleric------Cardinal`    


Features extended
=================
Players will be able to form a temporary group or form an alliance to take down the guardian. Solo groups will not be able to take it down by themselves.
The gamemode will be heavily based on crafting and raiding, bosses will drop crafting materials instead of instant gear. 


Crafting explained
==================
Let's say a user wants to craft the BEST sniper rifle there is. Let's name it Z.

To craft Z he needs to craft W first, a low tier sniper rifle.
Not only he needs to success to craft it, he needs to have an improved result - Improved W.
Then he can use Improved W to craft X. He will need Improved X to craft Y. Only then he can use the Improved Y to craft Z, which he may success at crafting, but this isn't the best version of the weapon yet - the best is Improved Z.

Ofcourse the chain of crafting will be smaller because this is just a gamemode not an actual gamemode (I would love to create this into an actual game but I can only Lua.)

Enchanting explained
====================
Players will be able to enchant gear from 0 to 16. Enchanted sets (helm/armor/pants/gloves) at specific enchanting points (4,8,12,16) give set boosts (run speed/defensive bonus/attack speed) while weapons give damage, accuracy, magazine boost.

Those are just the main points, there will be way more features and mechanics besides that.
